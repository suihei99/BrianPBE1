    <p align ="center"><font color = "#000000">The <strong>Cure Maid Café</strong> is a maid cafe in Akihabara. Kirino attended a first IRL meet up organized by Saori's "Otaku Girls Unite",an online community, in the cafe. It is located at the sixth floor of the Gee Store, near Suehirocho Station.</font> </p>

    <h2><font color = "#000000">Appearance</font></h2>
    <br>
    <p> <font color = "#000000">The <strong>Cure Maid Café</strong> has a layout similar to a traditional Western restaurant, with wooden chairs and tables, and a dominant earthy color scheme. However, what makes the Cure Maid Café stand out is the attire of its waitresses, whose theme is that of a typical maid café: black and white dresses adorned with ribbons and frills. The waitresses themselves are young as well, with ages probably ranging from middle school to high school level. Kirara Hoshino, the sister of Meruru's voice actor, is known to be one of the workers.</font></p>
